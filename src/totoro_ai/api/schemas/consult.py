The response carries the full `PlaceObject` per result (Tier 1/2/3 fields)
so the agent tool (see `agent-tool-design.md`) can project whichever
attributes it needs without a second fetch. The ranker's normalized score
is surfaced as `confidence` on each item.

# wrapper stamps source="tool", tool_name="consult", visibility="debug"
