"""Chip-status merge helpers (feature 023).

Two pure functions, separated by caller:

- `merge_chip_statuses(existing, submissions)` — applied when a chip_confirm
  signal arrives. Overwrites the `status` + `selection_round` of stored chips
  matched by `(source_field, source_value)`. Already-confirmed chips are
  preserved verbatim regardless of what the submission says (FR-006a).
  Chips in the submission that do not match any stored chip are ignored.
  Chips in `existing` not mentioned in the submission are preserved.

- `merge_chips_after_regen(existing, fresh)` — applied inside the taste
  regen job after the LLM returns a fresh chip list. Preserves confirmed
  chips verbatim; resets rejected chips to pending if the LLM's fresh
  signal_count exceeds the stored value; updates signal_count on pending
  chips; adds genuinely new LLM chips with status=pending.
