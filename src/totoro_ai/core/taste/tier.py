"""Signal-tier derivation (feature 023).

Pure function. No I/O, no persistence. Computed on demand from the user's
signal count and chip state and consumed by GET /v1/user/context and by any
future agent context node.

Stages are driven entirely by `config.taste_model.chip_selection_stages` —
a `dict[str, int]` mapping stage name to signal-count threshold. Adding or
removing a stage in config requires zero code changes here.
