"""Input/output types for the recall pipeline (feature 019, feature 028 M4).

`RecallFilters` is a Pydantic `BaseModel` extending the shared
`PlaceFilters` base (`core/places/filters.py`) per ADR-056. The
migration from `@dataclass` to Pydantic landed in feature 028 M4 — the
shared base plus the three retrieval-specific extensions
(`max_distance_km`, `created_after`, `created_before`) live here. Every
top-level `PlaceObject` key is reachable through the inherited base;
attribute-level signals (cuisine, price_hint, ambiance, dietary,
good_for, location_context) nest under `attributes: PlaceAttributes`.

`RecallResult` wraps a `PlaceObject` with the `match_reason` string and
optional `relevance_score` (populated only in hybrid mode).
