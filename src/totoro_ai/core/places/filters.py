"""Shared filter types for recall / consult / agent tools (feature 028 M4).

`PlaceFilters` mirrors `PlaceObject` 1:1 per ADR-056. `RecallFilters`
and `ConsultFilters` extend it with the retrieval-specific and
discovery-specific fields they each need.

`RecallFilters` lives in `core/recall/types.py` (imports and extends
`PlaceFilters` from here); `ConsultFilters` is declared here as a
sibling of `PlaceFilters`.
