"""Postgres-backed checkpointer factory (feature 027 M3, FR-030, research.md R2).

Uses `AsyncConnectionPool` so each checkpoint read/write acquires a fresh
connection from the pool rather than reusing one long-lived connection.
`from_conn_string` opens a single psycopg connection, which gets closed
after its context manager exits, causing "the connection is closed" errors
on the next LangGraph invocation. A pool avoids this by keeping N idle
connections alive and re-acquiring one per operation.

`setup()` is idempotent — repeated calls do not fail and do not overwrite
existing checkpoints. The three library-owned tables (`checkpoints`,
`checkpoint_blobs`, `checkpoint_writes`) are excluded from Alembic
autogenerate via `alembic/env.py::_include_object` (FR-031).
